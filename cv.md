3. I have been studying java programming language for two years now. It is simply impossible to convey the sensations when you open another site, or install any program, you immediately think what code it has. This is really cool and I would like to continue learning programming and improve my professional level.
4. Frameworks: Spring, Hibernate. 
   Database: MySQL, Postgresql
5. My study projects: https://github.com/AlenaBunko
6. My experience in programming is still small, but I am constantly trying to improve my skills.
7. Education: BSU (Faculty of Economics), Java-developer course at IT-college Digital Unicorn
8. Foreign language: I studied Spanish at school, but when I entered a higher educational institution I had to learn English. In my previous activity (I worked as an accountant), English was not needed, but I tried to improve the spoken language for traveling abroad. I have a great desire to learn English more professionally
